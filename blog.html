    <p>
     Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the internet.
     It usually refers to the user experience aspects of website development rather 
     than software development.Web design used to be focused on designing websites
      for desktop browsers; however, since the mid-2010s, design for mobile and
       tablet browsers has become ever-increasingly important. </p>
      <img src="blog1.jpg " alt="" width="70%" height="100%" style="padding-left:15%">
      
     <p> Two of the most common methods for designing websites that work well both on 
        desktop and mobile are responsive and adaptive design. In responsive design, 
        content moves dynamically depending on screen size; in adaptive design,
         the website content is fixed in layout sizes that match common screen sizes.
          Preserving a layout that is as consistent as possible between devices is
           crucial to maintaining user trust and engagement. As responsive design 
           can present difficulties in this regard, designers must be careful in
            relinquishing control of how their work will appear. If they are
             responsible for the content as well, while they may need to broaden
              their skillset, they will enjoy having the advantage of full control
               of the finished product.

     A well-designed website can help you form a good impression on your prospective
      customers. It can also help you nurture your leads and get more conversions.
       But, more importantly, it provides good user experience and helps your website 
       visitors access and navigate your website with ease.When a user lands on a site,
        good design can make them feel something. If the site looks modern, offers 
        bright colors, and is well organized – it's welcoming in visitors and encouraging 
        them to stick around for a whileYour website is one of the most important 
        aspects of your brand’s online presence and it's important that you 
        design it right. Your website is also the place where you nurture
         your bottom-of-the-funnel leads to get conversions. So, you can’t afford 
         any website fails that might cause your prospects to bounce off your website.
